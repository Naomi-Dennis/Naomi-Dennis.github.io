            <h2>
                <a id="What_is_it_0"></a>What is it?</h2>
            <p>The rails asset pipeline is a built in tool that implements files. Primarily, it is used for images, scripts
                and stylesheets.</p>
            <h2>
                <a id="How_to_include_files_3"></a>How to include files</h2>
            <p>When generating a Rails project, Rails will include the necessary lines to import all stylesheets and scripts.
                <br> It will look like the following:</p>
            <pre><code> &lt;%= stylesheet_link_tag 'application', media: 'all', 'data-turbolinks-track': 'reload' %&gt;
&lt;%= javascript_include_tag 'application', 'data-turbolinks-track': 'reload' %&gt;
            </code></pre>
            <p>Do not touch this.</p>
            <p>Next, you will copy all your scripts and stylesheets into the app &gt; assets folder. There are stylesheet and
                Javascript folders already available, you can paste your scripts in their respective folders. If you have
                any images, you can include them in the images folder. Please note, if the extension says
                <code>.scss</code> instead of
                <code>.css</code>, your code will still read properly and can be included in the same directory. The other file
                is a sass file, which is an extension of CSS.</p>
            <p>For this excercise, I suggest starting with very simple code that does not reference one another because Rails
                is very particular about how to do it. If you do not know what to use, you can use the files I’ve included
                here:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <a href="https://pastebin.com/tZruc58R" target="_blank">CSS</a>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="https://pastebin.com/D2Gd0NLM" target="_blank">JavaScript</a>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Put these in the
                <code>stylehseets/style.css</code> and
                <code>javascripts/script.js</code> files respectively. Now, run your server and you should see your CSS and Javascript
                files on your site.</p>
            <h2>
                <a id="Referencing_assets_21"></a>Referencing assets</h2>
            <p>Next, we will look at referencing other code (images in CSS and using Javascript inline functions).</p>
            <h4>
                <a id="CSS_25"></a>CSS</h4>
            <p>To add other files to a CSS property, such as a custom font or an image, simply use the image name and extension
                preceded by the asset_path function. To use this function, you will need to rename your css/scss file to
                <code>.css.erb</code>/
                <code>.scss.erb.</code>
            </p>
            <p>In the end, your code should look something like this:
                <br>
                <code>background: url(&lt;%= asset_path &quot;bkgrnd.jpeg&quot; %&gt;)</code>
            </p>
            <h4>
                <a id="Images_32"></a>Images</h4>
            <p>If you want to use put an image directly into a web page, like in an image tag; you would include it in a similar
                way.
                <br>
                <code>&lt;img src=&quot;&lt;%= asset_path &quot;bkgrnd.jpeg&quot; %&gt;&quot; &gt;</code>
            </p>
            <h4>
                <a id="JavaScript_37"></a>JavaScript</h4>
            <p>If you want to use inline script tags to create an onclick event, you can define the function used like so:
                <br> &lt;button onclick=&quot;&lt;%= “welcome();”%&gt;&quot;&gt;Greetings&lt;/button&gt;</p>
            <h2>
                <a id="Why_does_this_work_41"></a>Why does this work?</h2>
            <h4>
                <a id="Theory_Behind_the_Pipeline_43"></a>Theory Behind the Pipeline</h4>
            <p>Without getting into too much detail, the Rails asset pipeline is built on the sprocket gem. It is automatically
                included in all rails projects unless stated otherwise. The purpose of the pipeline is to compress all script
                and Javascript files into one master file and to give the ability to use language preprocessors like scss
                and erb. Hence the single include stylesheet and script lines included in the layout.</p>
            <p>Rails also uses a system called fingerprinting to ensure that files are only downloaded to the browser’s cache
                when the files content changes. This increases efficiency.</p>
            <h4>
                <a id="Why_the_Path_is_not_Needed_48"></a>Why the Path is not Needed</h4>
            <p>Why didn’t we need a relative path to find our image in the examples above? Because the pipeline uses “Rails
                magic” includes them based on the pipeline. When you use the function asset_path the Rails checks all the
                folders in the pipeline until it finds the appropriate path.</p>
            <h4>
                <a id="Organization_51"></a>Organization</h4>
            <p>One last important aspect of the Rails pipeline is the organization. There are three public folders the pipeline
                references:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>lib/assets
                    <ul>
                        <li>Non-frameworks written by you or your team, but is shared between various applications also written
                            by you or your team.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>vendor/assets
                    <ul>
                        <li>For JavaScript and CSS frameworks (think jQuery and Bootstrap)</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>app/assets
                    <ul>
                        <li>JavaScript and CSS functions you wrote that will be directly used in the application.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>
                <a id="Advanced_61"></a>Advanced</h2>
            <h4>
                <a id="Understanding_manifest_files_63"></a>Understanding Manifest Files</h4>
            <p>Manifest files are used to say what you want included in the asset pipeline. There is a single manifest file
                for CSS and for Javascript. They have slightly different syntax from one another, but the concept is the
                same. You will notice that each manifest file already has code in it. Now, automatically, both files will
                include everything in the entire pipeline. These files are useful for organizing what you want included.</p>
            <p>Each line begins with a require statement. If you want to include a single file, you would use:
                <br>
                <code>require [name_of_file_without extension].</code>
            </p>
            <p>For example:
                <br>
                <code>//= require pb_living</code>
            </p>
            <p>This will automatically find a file in the pipeline named pb_living.js. If this file were in a subfolder of Javascript,
                you would need to include the relative path. For example:
                <br>
                <code>//= require ./myscripts/pb_living</code>
            </p>
            <p>To include entire directories you would use:
                <br>
                <code>//= require_tree ./[relative_path_to_directory_name]</code>
            </p>
            <p>Note, that we are using a path here. This is what you use to create the pipeline. The
                <code>require_tree</code> directive tells Rails to include everything in the specified directory recursively (meaning
                to include all subfolders and files).</p>
            <p>To include everything in your directory, recursively, use:
                <br>
                <code>//= require_tree .</code>
            </p>
            <p>You can also include everything in a directory non-recursively (meaning everything in that folder, NOT including
                subfolders, etc.). That directive is called require_directive
                <br>
                <code>//= require_directive ./[relative_path_to_directory_name]</code>
            </p>
            <p>These require statements will include everything from top to bottom. There isn’t any documentation on how require_tree
                . includes files. To be safe, include any necessary files that need to be compiled before any others explicitly.</p>
            <h4>
                <a id="On_Preprocessing_88"></a>On Preprocessing</h4>
            <p>Precompilning your assets is useful as the browser can run your application quicker. The act of precompiling
                means to put a file in the intermediate stage of compiling. If you edit your files again after precompiling,
                you will need to precompile again.</p>
            <p>To precompile your assets use:
                <br>
                <code>rails assets:precompile</code>
            </p>
            <p>Of course you can denote the environment by preceeded this with RAILS_ENV=’’</p>
