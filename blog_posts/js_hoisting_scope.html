                </div>
                <p>Hoisting is the act of reading certain data before others. Take the following code:</p>
                <script src="https://pastebin.com/embed_js/jNnS1m2v"></script>
                <p>This raises some questisons.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Why is x undefined?</li>
                    <li>Why is plus defined?</li>
                    <li>Why is x undefined when I pass it to console.log, but it is defined when I call plus?</li>
                </ul>
                <p>To answer these questions, we need to know a few things about JavaScript.</p>
                <h1>
                    <a id="Scope_23"></a>Scope</h1>
                <p>Scope is the environment variables live in. Depending on where the variable is defined, the scope will be
                    able to see it.
                    <br> There are two basic kinds of scope, let’s look at them below. Consider the following example:</p>
                    <script src="https://pastebin.com/embed_js/YK7cTPr3"></script>
                <h4>
                    <a id="Local_32"></a>Local</h4>
                <p>Local scope is defined within a block. This can be the block of a function decleration, function expression,
                    for loops, while loops, etc. Local variables are defined within the block and can only be used within
                    that block. In this case, the local variable is y.</p>
                <h4>
                    <a id="Global_36"></a>Global</h4>
                <p>Global scope is defined outside of any block. Variables, function expressions, funcion declerations, etc.
                    defined in the global scope can be used within any inner blocks. In this case, the global variable is
                    x.</p>
                <h1>
                    <a id="Stack_40"></a>Stack</h1>
                <p>When your code is run, all actions are placed on something called a stack. Stack is a data structure that
                    can be thought of as a stack of plates. If you needed a plate from a stack of plates, you would take
                    the top plate off the stack and use it. This is how the browser interacts with your code. Before the
                    browser can interact with the stack, it has to create it. Let’s look at how it does that, considering
                    the code below:</p>
                    <script src="https://pastebin.com/embed_js/K79r4eun"></script>
                <h4>
                    <a id="Create_Variable_Name_Lookup_50"></a>Create Variable Name Lookup</h4>
                <p>The first thing the browser does, is create a lookup table of all variable names and function declerations.
                    So, let’s identify the structure used on each line that
                    <em>isn’t</em> a console.log call.</p>
                    <script src="https://pastebin.com/embed_js/iTFxLgN7"></script>
                <p>The browser will process your code line by line, from the top down.</p>
                <p>On Line 1: A variable is found. The browser will record the name
                    <strong>and only the name</strong>. x is now part of the lookup table.</p>
                <p>On Line 2: A function decleration is found. The browser will record the name
                    <strong>and the block</strong>. plus() is now part of the lookup table.</p>
                <h4>
                    <a id="Execution_63"></a>Execution</h4>
                <p>Next, the browser will once again look at your code from top to bottom, and execute the code on each line.
                    If you try to use a something that isn’t part of the look up table, you will get a ReferenceError.</p>
                <p>On Line 1: Variable x is being defined. I see x is part of the lookup table. x now equals 0.</p>
                <p>On Line 2: The browser will not go this far as plus() has already been added to the lookup table. Since the
                    execution process
                    <em>executes</em> code and this is just a decleration, the browser will do nothing when it gets to this line.</p>
                <h4>
                    <a id="Conclusion_70"></a>Conclusion</h4>
                <p>This was a simple examble. Before looking at more complex examples; let’s look at the let and var keywords.</p>
                <h1>
                    <a id="Let__Var_73"></a>Let &amp; Var</h1>
                <p>In JavaScript versions of yore, the var keyword was the only way to define a variable that wasn’t a class
                    or a function. Variable is still used in JavaScript, but it’s being phased out because it messes with
                    the execution context.</p>
                <p>For instance, the x variable from the example is used before its defined. The let keyword is the updated
                    version of var, introduced in ES6. The simplest definition of let is it can only be used in its scope.
                    If it’s defined in the global scope, it can be used globally; if it’s defined in the local scope, it
                    can only be used locally.</p>
                <p>Although it seems obvious, var doesn’t always do this. Variables declared with var is bound to the nearest
                    function, while let is bound to the nearest block. Consider the following example:</p>
                    <script src="https://pastebin.com/embed_js/e8AHj34y"></script>
                <p>As you can see, the x variable will still be defined outside of the for loop, because once its defined it’s
                    bound to the closeset function scope. In this case, it’s variableDifferences. The y variable on the other
                    hand, isn’t defined outside of the for loop, because its bound to the nearest block. In this case, it’s
                    the for loop block.</p>
                <h1>
                    <a id="The_Stack_ReVisited_94"></a>The Stack Re-Visited</h1>
                <p>So far we’ve covered how the stack is created and executed; defined the scope and the differences between
                    the let and var keywords. Now, we bring all the topics together in revisiting how the stack is composed
                    and executed.</p>
                <p>General rules for hoisting:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Add all variable names and function declerations to the lookup table.
                        <br> i. If the name is already there, don’t add it again.</li>
                    <li>Execute the code from the top down.
                        <br> i. If a variable that’s already defined is defined again; change its value.</li>
                </ol>

                <p>Now that we’ve learned so much about hoisting, let’s answer the questions asked at the start of the article.</p>
                <script src="https://pastebin.com/embed_js/jScekB0F"></script>
                <ul>
                    <li>Why is x undefined?
                        <ul>
                            <li>Its variable nams is added to the lookup table, but its referenced before its set to anything.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Why is plus defined?
                        <ul>
                            <li>plus is a function decleration, so it’s added to the lookup table, along with its block in prior
                                to the execution.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Why is x undefined when I pass it to console.log, but it is defined when I call plus?
                        <ul>
                            <li>By the time the browser reaches this log call, x has been defined in the lookup tablle.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
